# Lab Report 4: Editing using vim, and pushing changes to Git
## Step 4: Log onto ieng6
Because I previously generated an SSH key for ieng6, I do not need to enter my password. 
I typed in: `ssh cs15lsp23rd@ieng6.ucsd.edu` into the command-line and pressed `<enter>`to log in. 

The ssh command allows me to connect remotely to the ieng6 server, and the chunk of text after that is simply my course-specific account.
