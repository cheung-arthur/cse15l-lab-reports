# Lab Report 3: Interesting Command-line Options for grep
Note that for the examples below, I will already be in the `./technical` directory, and thus use relative paths to get to text files accordingly.
## Command Line Option 1: Count of Matches
The `$ grep -c [pattern] [file]` command allows us to see the number of matches/instances there are in the file, where `pattern` can be substituted for any string you want to find the count for, and `file` being the path for any text file.
### Example 1:
Input command: `grep -c Wolbachia plos/journal.pbio.0020068.txt`
Output: `11`
### Example 2:
Input command: `grep -c biodiversity plos/journal.pbio.0020406.txt`
Output: `9`
